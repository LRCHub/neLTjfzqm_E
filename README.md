```
I'm wide awake
But I'm stuck in a dream
Feels like I'm dreaming
And I
I can't tell if I'm alive
I left my body behind
Please wake me up
And I
Do my best to survive
But I been living lie
Please wake me up
Monsters in my head
Don't take me alive
They all want me dead
I don't wanna die
Don't play with my mind
Stop playing with my mind
Don't take me higher
I don't know how to fly
I got pressure on my mind
I should probably let it blow
I got monsters deep inside
I should probably let them go
I should probably let them go
I don't wanna let them go
Ooh I must be going blind
I feel like I'm seeing ghost
Freaking out and I don't wanna lose all my control
I been calling, screaming and shouting on my own
Need nobody
I got to fight it all alone
It ain't safe it's dangerous
'Cause I just don't know why I
('Cause I just don't know why I)
('Cause I just don't know why I)
I'm wide awake
But I'm stuck in a dream
Feels like I'm dreaming
And I
I can't tell if I'm alive
I left my body behind
Please wake me up
And I
Do my best to survive
But I been living lie
Please wake me up
I got pressure on my mind
I should probably let it blow
I got monsters deep inside
I should probably let them go
I should probably let them go
I don't wanna let them go
Ooh I must be going blind
I feel like I'm seeing ghost
Freaking out and I don't wanna lose all my control
I been calling, screaming and shouting on my own
Need nobody
I got to fight it all alone
It ain't safe it's dangerous
'Cause I just don't know why I
I keep
Falling
Straight through the sky
Angles and demons
Both by my side
I'm wide awake
But I'm stuck in a dream
Feels like I'm dreaming
And I
I can't tell if I'm alive
I left my body behind
Please wake me up
And I
Do my best to survive
But I been living lie
Please wake me up
(Please wake up)
(Please wake up)
Please wake me up
(Please wake up)
(Please wake up)
Please wake me up
